                  My hope is to help couples to understand more about the patterns that keep you feeling stuck. I give couples tools to engage with their emotions, needs, and longings so they can reach for their partners in new ways that create a safe and secure bond. My focus areas with couples are, pre-marital, marriage enrichment, communication issues, and recovering from infidelity.

            <h4>Getting Started</h4>
            <p>Starting therapy can be an intimidating experience, but it's also a brave step towards healing and growth. Here's what you can expect:
              <ol>
                <li>
                  <strong>Initial Contact</strong>
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Phone Consultation:</strong> We may connect via phone so I can get a sense of what you're looking for in therapy and answer any initial questions you may have. 
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>Scheduling an Appointment:</strong> If you feel comfortable moving forward, you'll schedule your first appointment. I will provide information about my availability, fees, and what to expect in your first session.
                </li>
                <li>
                  <strong>First Session:</strong> The first session is typically an intake session where I gather more detailed information about your concerns, background, and goals for therapy. You'll also discuss logistics like scheduling, fees, and confidentiality. This is a good time to ask any questions you may have about the therapeutic process.
                </li>
              </ol>

          <div class="question-container">
            <h3>What are online sessions like?</h3>
            <p>I use a HIPAA compliant platform. You are not required to download any new software. I will send you a link to your appointment and you can click on that link to enter the meeting. If you are wanting to use your phone for the online session then you would need to download the TeleHealth by Simple Practice app.</p>
            <p>
              If finding privacy in your house is a barrier please mention that to me and we can talk about various options. </p>

          <div class="question-container">
            <h3>How much is a therapy session?</h3>
            <p>A 45-50 minute session is $125.</p>
          </div>
          <div class="question-container">
            <h3>What can I expect starting therapy to be like?</h3>
            <p>For our first meeting I will want to learn more about you. We will talk about what is bringing you in and set goals for what kind of change you'd like to see. I use this information to tailor therapy so that our following sessions are the most helpful for your needs. The following sessions will be based on your goals. 
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question-container">
            <h3>What forms of payment do you accept?</h3>
            <p>I accept credit card (including VISA, MASTERCARD, AMEX and DISCOVER), cash, check and HSA or FSA cards.
            </p>
          </div>
          <div class="question-container">
            <h3>Do you accept insurance?</h3>
            <p>I am not currently accepting insurance. Insurance requires the diagnosis and release of all details in your medical record, which can sometimes limit the care you might need. For these reasons I am not accepting insurance. I am able to accept HSA and FSA cards. I offer receipts for clients to file for possible reimbursement with their insurance company.
